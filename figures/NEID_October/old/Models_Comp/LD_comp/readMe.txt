3 models: (1) projected RVs no cb (2) grass ccf RVs cb (3) grass ccf RVS no cb
3 LD models: (1) NL94 (2) KSSD (3) KHD
2 rms: (1) each model to line by line RVs (2) each model to pipeline RVs

NL94 / KSSD / KHD .png
3 models: 
(1) blue - projected RVs no cb 
(2) red - grass ccf RVs cb 
(3) green - grass ccf RVS no cb

solid circle = rms to line by line RVs
open circle = rms to pipeline RVs

* in most cases projected RVs no cb rms to pipeline RVs is best
# for rms to line by line RVs projected RVs no cb & grass ccf RVs cb similar but grass ccf RVs cb most often better

* most interested in grass ccf RVs cb so use those results to determine which LD model to use

grass ccf RVs cb model for each LD model
(1) blue - NL94
(2) red - KSSD 
(3) green - KHD

*will move forward with KSSD
