3 models: (1) projected RVs no cb (2) grass ccf RVs cb (3) grass ccf RVS no cb
3 KSSD + ext models: (1) KSSD (2) KSSD + ext (3) KSSD + 2 ext
2 rms: (1) each model to line by line RVs (2) each model to pipeline RVs

KSSD / KSSD_ext / KSSD_2ext .png
3 models: 
(1) blue - projected RVs no cb 
(2) red - grass ccf RVs cb 
(3) green - grass ccf RVS no cb

solid circle = rms to line by line RVs
open circle = rms to pipeline RVs

* in most cases projected RVs no cb rms to pipeline RVs is best
# for rms to line by line RVs projected RVs no cb & grass ccf RVs cb similar but grass ccf RVs cb most often better

* most interested in grass ccf RVs cb so use those results to determine which LD model to use

grass ccf RVs cb model for each LD model
(1) blue - KSSD
(2) red - KSSD_ext 
(3) green - KSSD_2ext

grass_cb_vs_ext_binned.png
now open cirles = binned by groups of 5 for rms to line by line RVs

* binning reduces rms in all cases

grass_cb_vs_2ext_changes.png
now open circles = results after geometry changes (better match)
